## Homework_1 - Linear Algebra
The principle of PCA was investigated using the example of a sound track.

## Homework_2 - Regression and Classification
A study of the principles of classification and regression was carried out. Compared the work of logistic and linear regression with the KNN method.

## Homework_3 - Optimization
Investigated optimization methods.

## Homework_4 - Introduction_to_DL
A fully connected neural network was developed for image classification using the example of Fashion MNIST.

## Homework_5 - Fundamentals_of_CV
The approach of training convolutional neural networks using Transfer Learning was investigated, different known architectures were compared with each other, with different approaches to accelerating learning change.

## Homework_6 - NLP
The own Seq2seq model was trained and the main approaches in NLP were explored.
